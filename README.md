# Maternal-Health-Risk-Classification
Designed and implemented a machine learning pipeline to predict maternal health risk levels using the Perinatal Risk Information dataset. Conducted thorough data exploration, preprocessing (handling missing values, feature scaling), and applied classification algorithms (Decision Tree, Random Forest). Tuned hyperparameters to enhance model performance and evaluated results using accuracy and a confusion matrix. Also addressed the ethical implications of deploying ML models in healthcare settings.

## Skills/Tools Used:
Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook, Data Preprocessing, Classification Algorithms, Hyperparameter Tuning, Model Evaluation, Confusion Matrix, Ethics in AI

## Dataset
- **Source**: Perinatal Risk Information Collection Dataset  
- **Features**: Age, blood pressure, and other clinical indicators  
- **Target**: Maternal health risk level (classification)

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook

## Tasks Performed
- Data exploration and preprocessing (missing values, scaling)
- Model selection: Decision Tree, Random Forest
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Evaluation using accuracy and a confusion matrix
- Comparative analysis of model performance

## Results
The models were evaluated on real-world health data with visual performance comparisons. Random Forest achieved better accuracy after hyperparameter tuning.

## Ethical Considerations
The project also reflects on the implications of using ML in healthcare, including bias, fairness, and transparency.
